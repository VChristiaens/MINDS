MINDS_reduction.ipynb : Example of reduction with default parameters. The background estimation and subtraction is only done at the moment of spectrum extraction, in the frames of the final spectral cube, The background estimate is made in an annulus around the source, and the subtraction compensates for the amount of PSF flux expected to be found in the annulus used for the background estimation.

MINDS_reductions_sdither.ipynb : Example of reduction with the "smooth dither" background estimation. For a 4-point dither observation, this method estimates the background in detector images, as the minimum of the 4 dither images, further smoothed with a median filter. The latter aims to further remove any remaining PSF signal (which could appear as thin lines on the detector) from the background estimate, while also performing a low-pass filter.

jwst_query.cfg : Example config file to download uncal files from MAST for your target, which are then used as input to the MINDS pipeline.
